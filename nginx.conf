# This is an Nginx configuration file for your Flask (Gunicorn) and React application.
#
# How to use:
# 1. Save this file as '/etc/nginx/sites-available/tatubu' on your server.
# 2. Create a symbolic link: 'sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/tatubu /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/'
# 3. Make sure you have SSL certificates. If not, you can get free ones from Let's Encrypt.
#    Replace 'your_domain' with your actual domain name (e.g., tatubu.com).
#    Update the paths to your SSL certificate and key files.
# 4. Test the configuration: 'sudo nginx -t'
# 5. Reload Nginx to apply changes: 'sudo systemctl reload nginx'
